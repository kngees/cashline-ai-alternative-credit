CASHLINE AI – Alternative Credit Intelligence System

Founder: Kingsley Obidimma Okeke
Sector: Fintech · Artificial Intelligence · Financial Inclusion

Overview

CASHLINE AI is an AI-driven alternative credit intelligence framework designed to assess creditworthiness for individuals and small businesses excluded by traditional credit scoring systems.

The project focuses on migrants, gig workers, digital creators, and SMEs whose financial behaviour is not adequately captured by legacy credit models.

The Problem

Traditional credit systems rely on historical banking data and formal employment records, leaving millions of financially active individuals “credit invisible”.

This exclusion limits access to:

Loans

Credit facilities

Business growth opportunities

The Solution

CASHLINE AI proposes a behavioural and alternative-data-driven credit assessment approach that focuses on:

Financial behaviour patterns

Consistency and reliability signals

Risk profiling through explainable AI logic

Automation-first decision workflows

Project Status

This repository currently documents:

The system concept and architecture

A technical whitepaper

A credit scoring logic demo (in progress)

The project is intentionally built as a practical, scalable fintech framework rather than an academic prototype.

Why This Matters

Financial inclusion is not only a social issue but an economic one.
CASHLINE AI is designed to complement existing fintech and banking infrastructure while expanding access responsibly.

Founder’s Vision

The long-term goal is to build AI-driven financial systems that are:

Ethical

Scalable

Commercially viable

Inclusive by design
